and proportionally).- 
Add an h1 below the image with the name of the place in the image.- 
Style it to be in Prata font, with a size of 64px and a weight of 400-

rounded borders for 6px, and a horizontal gradient as a background.

Create an unordered list below the h6 with 5 items in it,

(eg. name-of-place.html)- Update the information, image, h6 background gradient and 
links color in each page to represent the corresponding place- 
Add a footer outside of the main section, color it in black and make sure the text is white.
